# Contributing to Work Bitcoin Protocol

## 👋 Welcome

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Work Bitcoin Protocol! We're building open, public infrastructure to connect human work directly to Bitcoin.

## 🎯 Contribution Areas

### 1. Research & Specification
- Review and comment on RFCs
- Propose new RFCs using the template
- Research technical solutions to identified problems

### 2. Technical Documentation
- Improve existing documentation
- Create diagrams and visual explanations
- Translate documentation

### 3. Code Development
*Note: Code contributions will open once we establish the prototype repository*

## 📝 How to Contribute

### Step 1: Find an Issue
- Check [Issues](../../issues) for open discussions
- Look for "good first issue" labels
- Or start a new discussion if you have a well-researched idea

### Step 2: Discuss First
For significant changes:
1. Open a Discussion or Issue explaining your proposal
2. Gather feedback from the community
3. For major changes, create an RFC using the template

### Step 3: Make Your Contribution
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-idea`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing idea'`)
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-idea`)
6. Open a Pull Request

## 🧪 RFC (Request for Comments) Process

### When to Create an RFC
- Proposing significant architectural changes
- Introducing new components or protocols
- Changing core assumptions or trade-offs

### RFC Structure
Use the [RFC-TEMPLATE.md](./RFCs/TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point.

### RFC Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Initial proposal, seeking feedback
2. **Review**: Active discussion, revisions made
3. **Accepted**: Consensus reached, ready for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Code exists that follows the RFC
5. **Rejected/Withdrawn**: Not moving forward

## 💬 Communication

### GitHub Issues
- Use for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions
- Be respectful and assume good faith
- Stay on topic

### Matrix/Chat
*Coming soon: Official chat channels*

### In-Person
- Bitcoin meetups and conferences
- Local working sessions

## 🏗️ Development Setup

*Will be added when code repositories are created*

## 🔍 Code Review Process

1. At least one maintainer must review PRs
2. All tests must pass
3. Documentation must be updated
4. Security implications considered

## 📜 License
