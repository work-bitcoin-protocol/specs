# Work Bitcoin Protocol

A non-custodial protocol on Lightning Network that enables verifiable human work to be directly exchanged for Bitcoin, creating a P2P bridge between local economies and global sound money.

## 📖 Problem Statement

Traditional local economies face:
- **Currency depreciation**: Local fiat loses value rapidly
- **Limited access**: No direct path to global sound money
- **High fees**: Remittance costs up to 10-15%
- **Centralized control**: Banking intermediaries required

🎯 Core Components
1. Work Verification Layer

    Zero-knowledge proofs of work completion

    Decentralized attestation network

    Physical verification fallback

2. Asset Issuance (Taproot Assets)

    Local work tokens as Taproot Assets

    1:1 redeemable for Bitcoin

    Non-custodial by design

3. Lightning Network Settlement

    Instant Bitcoin payments

    Sub-cent transaction fees

    Global liquidity access

4. Sybil Resistance

    Hybrid proof-of-personhood

    Trust graphs with attenuation

    Periodic physical verification
